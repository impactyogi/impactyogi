Hi, I'm Hannah, (she/her), Site Reliability Engineer at the Economist. Led by a love for linguistics, culture and diversity I have lived and worked in 6 countries,(UK, SE, FR, IT, ES, GT) . Along the way I got into strategy, entrepreneurship, data, product, sales and marketing, finding my driving passion in the intersection between business and social impact within social enterprise. I became interested in tech for its capacity to create scalable solutions to real world problems which cross physical boundaries and require relatively low start-up capital in comparison to traditional bricks and mortar businesses.
