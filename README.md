Hi, I'm Hannah, (she/her), Site Reliability Engineer at the Economist. Led by a love for linguistics, culture and diversity I have lived and worked in 6 countries,(UK, SE, FR, IT, ES, GT). Along the way I got into strategy, entrepreneurship, data, product, business development and marketing, finding my driving passion in the intersection between business and social impact within social enterprise. I became interested in tech for its capacity to create scalable solutions to real world problems which cross physical boundaries and require relatively low start-up capital in comparison to traditional bricks and mortar businesses.

### Let's build together!

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on finding my flow to reshape my career in a new sector and location.
- ðŸŒ± In my free time I am tinkering on side projects in CNC, biodomes, aquaponics, biodiesel, sustainbility & open source. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about SRE, DevSecOps, entrepreneurship, economics, data, sustainability, career change or building things.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with: generating social or environmental value through tech.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: LinkedIn, Github.
