Hi, I'm Hannah, (she/her), Site Reliability Engineer at the Economist. I have lived and worked in 6 countries,(UK, SE, FR, IT, ES, GT) and though what initially led me there was learning the languages, cultures and understanding the people. In the world of work I learnt a lot about data, strategy, product, sales, marketing, entrepreneurship and developing economies, finally finding my driving passion in the intersection between business and social impact within social enterprise.

This led me to question how to increase social, environmental and positive economic impact and I became interested in tech for its capacity to create scaleable solutions to real world problems which can cross physical boundries and continents and require relitively low start-up capital in comparison to traditional bricks and mortar businesses.
